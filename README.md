# Stocks-App-Using-Python

Application deployed using GCP. 
URL : https://stocksdata-finnhub-84783782.uw.r.appspot.com/

Created a single page web application that allows users to search for stocks using the Finnhubb API and display the results on the details page. 
A user will first open a page where he can enter the stock ticker symbol and select from a list of matching stock symbols using “autocomplete.” A quote on a matched stock symbol can be performed. There are 4 routes for this application: a) Homepage/ Search Route [‘/’] – It is a default route of this application. b) Watchlist Route [‘/watchlist’] – It displays the watchlist of the user. c) Portfolio Route [‘/portfolio’] – It displays the portfolio of the user. d) Details Route [‘/details/’] – It shows the details of the stock.
